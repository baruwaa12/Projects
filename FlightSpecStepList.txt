
1. Create an input for the user to enter their flight specification. It will need to follow the format of "AMS 0 25 S E"

AMS - Amsterdam
GLA = Glasgow

0 - Refers to the Number of bags

25 - Both digits refer to the age of the passenger 

S, V, N - Standard, Vegetarian, No Meal

E,F - Seating Class (Economy or First class)



2. if NumOfBags = 0 or 1, set bagCost = 0

   if NumOfBags >= 2; bagCost = (NumOfBags - 1) * 20



3. BasicFlightCostAMS = 150
   BasicFlightCostGLA = 80
   CurrentTotalFC = 0

   If PassengerAge <= 15 and destination is AMS:
	CurrentTotalFC = BasicFlightCostAMS / 2

   If PassengerAge <= 15 and destination is GLA:
	CurrentTotalFC = BasicFlightCostGLA / 2


4. Set MealCost = 0
   if PassengerAge <= 15 and meal = "S"
        MealCost = 7.50
    else:
	MealCost = 10.00
   
   if PassengerAge <= 15 and meal = "V"
        MealCost = 9.50
     else:
	  MealCost = 12.00
  
	
5.  If SeatingClass = F
	TotalFC = (CurrentTotalFC * 6)
    else:
	TotalFC = CurrentTotalFC


6. Print a summary of these 7 points
	- Destination Airport
	- Flight Cost
	- Number of bags
	- Baggage Cost
	- Meal Cost
	- Seating Class
	- Total Cost
